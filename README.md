# DiGro-Dart
IoT based Agricultural Water Pumping station Monitor and Control System

A Digital Dart in Agriculture (DiGro-Dart) was a start-up project focusing on designing and development of an IoT based monitor and control system 
for diesel engine powered agricultural used water pumping stations. 

There are three main parts in the project.
1. Sensors' data retreving and sending to a cloud server (AWS server)
2. DGD AWS cloud server 
3. Mobile application for monitoring and control 

The project was based in Yangon Myanmar in 2019 with two embedded system engineers, one server administrator, one data analyst and three developer advocates.
The team invested more than 19 months of our time in designing the system and the product is now at product-level prototype phase.
The system is also tested in real world with real water pumping station and iterating the development to become a beta version product.  
But because of the situations in Myanmar, the development is currently postponed and going very slowly.
